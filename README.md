# Claude-desktop
Desktop application for Claude.ai.

OpenAI doesn't allow me to pass their paycheck, so I chose Claude as my AI assistant. I reviewed many open-source projects, and most only have basic text chat functionality without support for online search or browse. Therefore, I decided to develop a clean version based on the open-source project [Chatbox](https://github.com/Bin-Huang/chatbox.git), removing many of its commercial features, and adding support for Claude. 
Additionally, I removed all other model configurations except for Claude, as I couldn't test those features, but I still retained extensibility, so you can add your own. 

This project is clean and pure, it runs entirely locally and will not initiate any requests except for the API interface.

This project is mainly for personal use, so I haven't done much testing on other OS platforms.
