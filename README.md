## Background üìö

This project was inspired by the need for a clean, feature-rich desktop chatbot application. While reviewing various open-source projects, we noticed most lacked essential features like online search and browsing capabilities. Based on the open-source project [Chatbox](https://github.com/Bin-Huang/chatbox.git), we've created a streamlined version that removes commercial features while adding support for Claude and OpenRouter.
